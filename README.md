<h2>What I learnt from this project?</h2>

1> How to Pass a state from one component to another using state

2> How to use Redux to pass state from lower to higher order without the standard unidirectional flow.

3> How to use material UI in your project.

4> How to store data in the form of Cart.

Need of Redux

    ~Inorder to pass the state from 1 component to another 
    
    ~like from home to navbar inorder to get the cart no. updated.

Redux flow

1>App.js provider wrap and pass store to provider
not now

2> store.js create in src

3> create actions to take from home.js 
dispatch the action of type: ____ from type.js

4> action-> reducer-> store
